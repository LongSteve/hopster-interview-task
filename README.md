# Hopster Mobile developer interview task #

This is a small Cocos2d-x game I put together in a around 5 hours.  It has all the things you might expect,
although it's obviously not very complex.  Also, the coding style is quite rushed, but I didn't want to
spend days and days doing this!

The game is self contained, build and run it, and follow the instructions.
