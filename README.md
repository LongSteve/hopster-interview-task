# Hopster mobile developer interview task #

This is a small Cocos2d-x game I put together in around 4:30 hours of total coding (longer in real time, but with breaks).
It has all the things you might expect, although it's obviously not very complex.  
The coding style is also quite rushed, but I didn't want to spend days and days doing this!

The game is nicely self contained, build and run it, and follow the instructions.

# Time lapse video #

While coding this project, I recorded myself using OBS as if I was live streaming, although without the usual chat! You can view a 1 minute time lapse video of the coding sessions on YouTube here.
